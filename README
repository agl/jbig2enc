Welcome, gentle reader.

This is an encoder for JBIG2:
www.jpeg.org/public/fcd14492.pdf

JBIG2 encodes bi-level (1 bpp) images using a number of clever tricks to get
better compression than G4. This encoder can:
   * Generate JBIG2 files, or fragments for embedding in PDFs
   * Generic region encoding
   * Perform symbol extraction, classification and text region coding
   * Perform refinement coding and,
   * Compress multipage documents

It uses the (Apache-ish licensed) Leptonica library:
  http://leptonica.com/

You'll need version 1.68.

KNOWN BUGS:

The refinement coding causes Acrobat to crash. It's not known if this is a bug
in Acrobat, though it may well be.


USAGE:

See the jbig2enc.h header for the high level API, or the jbig2 program for an
example of usage:

$ jbig2 -s -p -v *.jpg && pdf.py output >out.pdf

to encode jbig2 files for pdf creation.
If you want to encode an image and then view output first to include in pdf

$ jbig2 -s -S -p -v -O out.png *.jpg

If you want to encode an image as jbig2 (can be view in STDU Viewer) run:

$ jbig2 -s feyn.tif >feyn.jb2
